 - The tool should be able to handle a load of up to 1000 active secrets at any given time.
 - Recovery Time Objective should be Very high.
 - Recovery Point Objective can be Low. ***
 - You do not need integrations with any IdP for login, and the tool can provide anonymous access.
   Assumnption: 
    - Application is hosted in cloud and authentication is mandate to access any resource in cloud.

	Task 2: (Secret Receiver) GET API CALL ** || SELECT 
	- It Should receive Unique path and PIN. 
	- Validate the PIN. 
	- It Should Return the Secret.

	- Secrets should only be one-time accessible and expire.
	- Allow 3 attempts for a PIN.  
	- Secrets should expire after 24 hours.
	- The secret can only be text. 
	- Text length should be of less than 1KB and a maximum length of 100KB. 
	- Users can be advised to base64-encode other formats for sharing as text, and to be decoded locally by the recipient.
